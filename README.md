# undefined Travel
'Undefined' is a speed challenge! We had 24 hours to develop a web application with the theme of "holidays".
So we worked on a search bar which allow you to select a country, a city and a date range, and the app gives you all the events happening in the selected city within the selected dates.

Language : HTML / CSS / Javascript / React JS / Git / Github
Webdesign done by myself.

We used 3 API :
- To get all the cities of a selected country
- To display a background picture corresponding to the selected city
- To display all the events happening in the selected city withing the selected date range
